Made it through lush vallies toward an awesome museum/unexpected workshop thanks to the recommemdation of @therealashketchum. Loved the quality of this traditional handmade paper since my first forays into printmaking. Such an awesome way to conclude these two months of traveling with a ream of my own Mulberry fiber based Washi in hand. Thanks again 日比野啓市! stoked to hopefully showcase your skills this summer with the fledgling printmakers at CSSSA
