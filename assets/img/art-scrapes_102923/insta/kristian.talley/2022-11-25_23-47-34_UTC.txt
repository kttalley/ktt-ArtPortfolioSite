Through my days as a scribbler I’ve been able to pursue countless interesting threads of perception and meaning via mark and paper. These pursuits and resulting artifacts are always most rewarding when guided by shared projects— those that enable lines and geometry to be informed by the lyrics, textures, tones and rhythms of others’ work especially.

“‘a lo-fi beat’ is both the only single and only vocal track from ‘the dreamer in their tower,’ an album that scores a dream sequence through a series of instrumental vignettes. Combining both ambient loops and hip-hop beats, this album is a sonic exploration of tones and vibrations that swathe my consciousness.”

I struggle to articulate what @nahhphet sharing his vision, via his invitation to collaborate without expectation, has meant to me on an existential level. Driven by a mystical curiosity generously imparted, it’s something that has and continues to invite me to look beneath the surface of my own perceptions and conceptions.

 “It releases next month, alongside a book of prose poetry that offers narrative interpretations for each of the 26 beats on the album.”
 
In the meantime, I invite you to investigate @nahhphet ‘s work in your own way. But definitely go see him shred at @palacio_palace tomorrow in the grass during sunlight hours.
