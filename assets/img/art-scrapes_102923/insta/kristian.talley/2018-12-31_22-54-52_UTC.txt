2018 was my sister's second suicide attempt. 2018 was my brother's mental health declining to the point where he also began entertaining suicidal thoughts and disturbing delusions of supressed childhood memories and traumas that hadn't happened. Finding a means or access to the life saving mental health support and care my little brother and sister desperately need has been arduous and remains elusive. It has also been the fracture point for a complete and total communication breakdown for all members of my tight knit family of 5 that I grew up believing unconditional and invincible in its bond and love.

I am supported. But a lot of people aren't when it comes to matters of mental illness, which is often a matter of life and death. Understanding what else I can do to support the ones I love most is what my 2019 will be all about. If my story is in anyway familiar, I invite you to reach out and share yours. I want my little siblings to see 2020.
