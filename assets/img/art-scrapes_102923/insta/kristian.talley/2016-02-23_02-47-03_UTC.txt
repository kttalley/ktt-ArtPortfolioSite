Really honored to have been requested to design a something for the band Two Brothers:

I genuinely dig there sound and this piece was an open ended reflection created by doodlin to their tunes. Go check em out! I have about 4 weeks left before I leave the country. Hit me up with any design requests you or your friends may have before then. Cheerz
