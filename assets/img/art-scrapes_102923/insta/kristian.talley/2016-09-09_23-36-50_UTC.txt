it's been way too long since I've had anything mailed my way. endlessly humbled for this collaborative offset litho zine tenderly drafted up by @paulaalou & @sea_der . check out their work!! these two were some of the most driven creative people I've had the privlige of sharing classes and studio space with. not to mention some of the kindest & most sincere peeps!! miss ya both. glad to see the east coast has been fruitful <3
