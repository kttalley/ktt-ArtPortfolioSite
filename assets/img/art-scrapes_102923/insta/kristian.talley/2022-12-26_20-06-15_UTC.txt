The Dreamer in Their Tower is a series of instrumentals across ambient & hip-hop modalities that scores a dream sequence ambiguated for the sake of the listener’s personal exploration. A work @nahhphet began two years ago, the album represents a balance between the dynamism admired in beats and the meditative repetition of loops they’re drawn to. 

The album will open on Bandcamp (https://nahhphet.bandcamp.com/) this 12/31 alongside preorders for an accompanying book (set for delivery mid-January).

The book offers one potential interpretation for the dream sequence of the album, lending each of the 26 instrumentals a prose poem by which its sonic-emotional textures might be understood. Each poem was written by @nahhphet listening to the album, drawing influence from the symbols of his own dreams and the archetypes/structures of Jungian dream analysis. These are paired with illustrations I’ve been fortunate enough to develop in collaboration with @nahhphet .
