Got around to uploading an album of 12 tracks from this last year online for the people who didn't get a hard copy:

Thanks so much to my housemates @shawheeeen, Kevin Hall, John Kang, Alex Rowe and all the other countless creative crazy individuals who imparted their knowledge and encouragement to make this vision possible. Thanks for listening your support means a lot!!
