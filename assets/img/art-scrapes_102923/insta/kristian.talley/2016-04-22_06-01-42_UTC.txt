!¡SAMURAII¡!
been so overwhelmed and overstimulated I haven't been drawing near enough since I got here. It was good to slow down for a day to get this one done. here's to hoping all the visual motifs ive been geeking out on settle in for good! (Thanks for the bday wishes yall are hella sweet supportive peeps with whom I'm so grateful i get to keep sharing with.)
