detail of stateproof four. went ham on the handpowdered aquatint (ill never rock it as well as Goya) and sugarlift. my favorite thing about the sugartlift resists are the physical indentions you feel on the paper from the violent textures of dissolving copper. unpredictability is beautiful. overworking a piece ain't. proof right here why i never finish anything. cuz potential unrealized is better than the potential you suffocate
