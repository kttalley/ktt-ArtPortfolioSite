The artwork to go along with a 14 track project I finished a couple months back with the help of many homies.

What started as a single song exploring the notion of the familiar kinda took off on a fullfledged meditation.. I sorta hoped to abstract the process of growing close to another and the inherent projection of ourselves onto those we identify with and love, human or not.

But that's just the emotional starting point that may or may not come across. Went off the deep-end with NES plugins and Majora's Mask samples... interspersed among some old fashioned singsong. Thanks for looking and listening. And thanks to the many minds that went into bringing 'critters' about. if nothing else it helped make sense of a wonderfully uncomfortable process.
